    I'm an indie full-stack developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time.
    All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
    All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches.
    I publish that content on my YouTube channel
    "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ForrestKnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ForrestKnight</a>"
    to more than 600k subscribers.
